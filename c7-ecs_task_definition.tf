# BUG Found with terraform plan command and casual lookup
# 1st: security issue -> Mongodb atlas db password is stored hardcoded in manifest. Which will reveal the key publically when terraform manifest will be uploaded onto remote repo.
# To fix this we will create vault in secrets manager and provide the value into environment using attribute "valueFrom" which will be given the arn to that secret

# 2nd: Container mapping is incorrect. As container port is set at 3000 which means application will be running inside container on 3000, but the host port hardcoded to 8080 which will eventualluy fails the healthcheck at target group level.
# Fix will be using same as container port to map the host and containers port.

# 3rd: in environment variables providing port cannot pass the numeric value it needed to be using plain text values.
# Fix: use tostring() function which will convert the numeric to plain string.
