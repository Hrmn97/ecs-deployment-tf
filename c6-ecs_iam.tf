# BUG Found with terraform validate command
# Error: "policy_arn" (arn:aws:iam::policy/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy) is an invalid ARN: arn: not enough sections
# │ 
# │   with aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.task_execution_policy,
# │   on c6-ecs_iam.tf line 23, in resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "task_execution_policy":
# │   23:   policy_arn = "arn:aws:iam::policy/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy"

# FIX is to use proper arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy. Take it from aws console IAM -> Policies -> search "AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy" -> copy the arn

# Fix: Wrong Principal service ec2.amazonaws.com given. 
# We need to put ecs-tasks.amazonaws.com as this role will be attached to task definition in ecs so it reuires ecs-tasks instead of ec2.
